Description of the project
HippoNote is a simple note taking application which  will allow users to keep track of todo lists, class notes, personal notes and basically anything that they need to put down in short form so as to not forget it in future.

Learning objectives
Learn how to use a cloud database provider.
Learn how to integrate mongodb and nodejs in the cloud.
Fully integrate a testing framework with web applications.
Learn usage of npm scripts and packages to automate building and deployment of applications.
Learn how to use a mongodb cloud provider.
Learn how to use twig for creation of dynamic templates.

Technologies used

The application will comprise of a traditional mvc architecture plus an api to aid in dynamic loading of some frontend features.

The technologies to be used are as follows;

Backend
nodejs as the runtime
mongodb for the database
jwt based authentication and session management

Libraries
express -> backend framework
jsonwebtoken -> jwt management
twig -> dynamic html template generation
mongoose -> database object relational mapper
unit tests -> mocha, chai
nodemon -> running application in dev environment

Frontend
bootstrap 5 -> styling html pages
bootstrap 5 -> dynamic html pages


Third party services
mongodb atlas -> cloud database provide

Challenges
Integration of tests while developing continuously may pose a challenge.
A few of the technologies are not very well known. a learning curve needs to be undergone in a short period of time.

Workflow:
Commits and merges
For each new feature being added, a branch will be created. Each implementation of any detail of a single feature will be accompanied with a unit test. Once each of the details of the feature has been completed, an integration test will be done to ensure the component functions well with the other components. The branch will then be merged into the main branch once this is completed. Once it is ascertained that everything works as expected, this branch is going to be deleted.

Unit tests
Mocha and chai will be used as the testing frameworks.
For each new feature added, an accompanying unit test will also be implemented.
Once the unit test passes, the feature will be integrated into the main branch.
